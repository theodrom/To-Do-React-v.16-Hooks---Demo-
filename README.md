# To-Do demo

This is a demo-app based on React 16.7 _alpha version with **Hooks**.  

**Hooks** are functions that let us “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. **Hooks** don’t work inside classes — they let us use React without classes.  

In this demo, we are using only the **useState()** hook. The **useState()** returns a pair of values: the current state value (todos) and a function (setTodos) that lets us update the state.  

The demo is based on this tutorial: <https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-react-to-do-app-with-react-hooks-no-class-components?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=build_a_crud_app_with_react_hooks_implement_smooth_scrolling_in_react&utm_term=2018-11-14>
